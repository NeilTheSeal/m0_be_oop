# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I feel pretty confident going into mod 1. I feel like I have understood the assignments and coursework enough that I will not struggle to keep up in Mod 1.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I usually get assignments done the night of the live lesson, or the day after. So I am staying ahead on my work for the most part.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Always run your code after writing a block of code to make sure it works. I almost committed some changes without even testing to see if it worked, then I ran the file and realized I forgot an "end" statement in one of the class declarations.
